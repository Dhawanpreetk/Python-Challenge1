# Python-Challenge1
Python project

It had two projects with the name of Pybank and Pypoll. Both the projects has respective data sets for which I had to give  a finacial Analysis and Elections summary for respective datasets:


Below are the instructions for Pybank and pypoll respectively : 

Pybank : 
This Challenge was about  creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. There is a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

 Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll :

This Challenge,was with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

There is a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won
